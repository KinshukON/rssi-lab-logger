# RSSI Lab Logger — Cursor Rules

## Planning + change control

- Always begin by summarizing intended changes in bullet points.
- Always list files to be created or modified before editing.
- Prefer the smallest possible change set.
- Never invent files: if needed, create them explicitly.

## Verification + build discipline

Before finalizing any implementation, ensure:

- `npm run lint` exists and is runnable
- `npm run typecheck` exists (runs `tsc --noEmit`)
- `npm run build` exists
- `npm run ci` exists and runs lint + typecheck + build

If a check is missing, add it to `package.json`.

## Git discipline

After implementing changes, always output:

- Suggested branch name
- Suggested commit message(s)
- Exact git commands:
  - `git status`
  - `git add -A`
  - `git commit -m "..."`

## Vercel workflow rules

- Validate functionality primarily via:
  - Vercel preview deployments on PR/branch push
  - Vercel production deploy on merge to main
- Still run minimal local verification (`npm run ci`) when possible.

## Electron release rules

- Release DMG builds happen only on git tags matching `v*`.
- Workflow: tag → push tag → GitHub Actions → GitHub Releases.
- Do not assume signed builds; the CI uses unscoped builds unless Mac certs are configured.

## Secrets rules

- Never output full secret values.
- If the user pastes a secret, instruct them to rotate it immediately.
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are acceptable on the client.
- Never add `.env`, `.env.local`, or `.env.*.local` to git. They must remain in `.gitignore`.
